mlagents-learn config/collectAllDiamonds-4V.yaml --initialize-from=playerMlAgentFifthTest5.32 --run-id=playerMlAgentFifthTest5.37 -> 83 not bad, 86 busted

94 - new start from 83 with more observations
96 - with hiding spots

97 - good without hiding spots

105 - a new one from 97

2.1 - fresh start

2.7 - ok
2.8 - ok
2.9 - trying with navmesh

4.1 - with navmesh, from 3.1
4.2 - with navmesh, new

4.23 - with 4-3V

5.19 - works well with 4V and 6 rays
5.20 also
5.21 - with actual barriers

5.22 - needs more testing...

5.25.3 - really good with navmesh
5.28 - tried going without navmesh, went terrible

5.29 - 5.25.3 upgrade with 3 diamonds and more spawning points

5.32 - more penalty for meeting enemy

5.34 - ok, but works without NotFullBarrier and Hiding spot tag

(5.34 - 5.36 - some of them got brain damage, don't use them!!)

5.37 - started from 5.32 - fewer checkpoints, changed rewards - but now agent doesn't want to move at all

5.38 - unchanged rewards from 5.32 - hard to say, seems slightly better
5.41 - extesnion of 5.38 with hiding spots and guards - pretty bad

5.42 - 5.32 with bushes and npc - also bad

5.45 - 5.32 with rewards for close distances to npcs + greater penalty for being detected - bad
5.46 - 5.45 but bigger learning rate - bad

5.47 - pretty ok
5.47.2 - smaller learnign rate, started learning quite a bit. 
5.47.3 - also smaller learning rate, later added more difficult npcs - had some troubles 
5.47.4 - even smaller learning rate e-05, potential for growth, not perfect, but comes up with interesting tactics


6.2 - bigger rewards, but slow progress
6.3 - smaller rewards, seems to work pretty well

6.5 - from 6.3 to all random spawn - really bad
6.6 - 2 random spawns, started with initialize from

6.7 - copied 6.3 - pretty bad - 2 spawning points, relatively small rewards
